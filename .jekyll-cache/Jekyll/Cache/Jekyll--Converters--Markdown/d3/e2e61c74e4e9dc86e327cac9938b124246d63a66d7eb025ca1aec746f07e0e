<p>Such questions are not new and have been documented for millennia.  In the area of the world where civilisation first emerged, ancient Mesopotamia, the Akkadian (Babylonian/Assyrian) term for “fate” was <em>šīmtu</em>.  It appears throughout the Akkadian corpus: hymns, prayers, medical and diagnostic texts, astronomical texts, treaties, royal inscriptions, omens and protective rituals.  This book is a conceptual study of the complex of ideas which attach themselves to the term <em>šīmtu</em>.  In particular, it examines the role of the gods in human affairs—their ability to determine the individual human life.  But it also examines the nature of divinity and the gods’ own susceptibility to fate.</p>

<p>This book also seeks to show the impact that <em>šīmtu</em> was understood to have on the lives of ancient Mesopotamians through examining both their authoritative texts which dealt with <em>šīmtu</em> — especially omen texts — as well as their well-established rituals, which owed their existence to the determination of fate: the substitute king ritual and the new year (<em>akitu</em>) festival.  What comes to light in this study is that the world view embodied in <em>šīmtu</em> is descriptive of a “closed-system” universe, wherein all human life and options are predetermined by the gods.</p>
