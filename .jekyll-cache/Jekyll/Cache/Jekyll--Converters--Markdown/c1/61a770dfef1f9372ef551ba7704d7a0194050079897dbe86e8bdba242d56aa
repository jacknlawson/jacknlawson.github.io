I"<p>No Good Deed is a story which examines Americaâ€™s two great passions: religion and warâ€”revealing how the former can be as destructive as the latter, and how each glossed with a patriotic morality which hides their darker realities.  The story begins at the graveside service of Rev. Kyle Weston (following his suicide), conducted by his best friend, Rev. Jon Braddock.</p>

<p>Much is told through conversations between Jon and Kyleâ€™s surviving mother and sister, as each tries to piece together what led to Kyleâ€™s ultimate self-destruction.  That narrative begins in the early 1960s, and is developed against the backdrop of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, sex, drugs and Vietnam.</p>

<p>The novel follows the friendship of Jon and Kyle as their lives alternately intertwine and separate along their journey to manhood; with both eventuallyâ€”and for very different reasonsâ€”becoming ordained ministers.  Vietnam is the first dividing point, as Kyle drops out of college and chooses military service, while Jon follows his pacifist convictions and goes to Canada.  Kyleâ€™s experience in Vietnam leaves him scarredâ€”literally and figurativelyâ€”for life.</p>

<p>As the Vietnam War winds to its conclusion, the friends are reunited and Jon learns of the specific event that has both left his best friend so damaged and has become so determinative of Kyleâ€™s future: his killing of three young children.  Their reunion is uneasy due to Kyleâ€™s PTSD, which he â€˜self-medicatesâ€™ with alcohol.</p>

<p>For a decade, Kyle adopts the life of a loner and seemingly drifts, while Jon marries and pursues his ministry vocation (becoming a college chaplain).   The two friends are firmly reunited (in the mid 1980s), with Jon now a divorced minister and single father to a young daughterâ€”not the â€˜done thingâ€™ for most Protestant denominations at that time.  Thus he is effectively banished to the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge, where he serves two small churches.</p>

<p>Kyle appears at Jonâ€™s door one dayâ€”unannouncedâ€”and tells Jon of his sense of call into ministry.  He seeks Jonâ€™s help and support in pursuing his vocation, which is specifically to work with Americaâ€™s endless stream of ex-servicemen and women suffering from PTSD.  After Kyleâ€™s ordinationâ€”and a number of years laterâ€”Kyle realizes that his work with PTSD sufferers has, to some degree, kept him from moving on from his own trauma.</p>

<p>He decides to accept the call to parish ministry in a small town close to where Jon works.  On the surface, all seems fine; but within weeks of assuming his role of minister at the church, Kyle discovers a hidden world of child abuse, fraud and embezzlement.  The two friends are pitched headlong into a battle with both an institutional church which manipulates the truth and admits no guilt, and a local community which closes ranks against the â€˜outsiders.â€™  The abuse of pre-school children under the â€˜careâ€™ of the staff at Kyleâ€™s church re-ignites the nightmare of his experience in Vietnam.  That, plus the ensuing â€˜warfareâ€™ within the church, leads Kyle to take his own life.  In the aftermath, Jon knows he can no longer serve, in good conscience, as a minister in the institutional church.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œâ€˜No Good Deedâ€™ by Jack N. Lawson is a coming-of-age story wrapped in a mystery. Jon and Kyle were inseparable school chums in the late 60â€™s, each confident and self-assured. But they were soon pulled apart, Jon becoming a college peace activist and Kyle flying missions in Vietnam. How each ended up where he did is revealed in the first chapter; how they ended up that way is the mystery. There are moments of unforgettable descriptive clarity and uncommon insight into the hearts of two decent people, moments when war experiences, personal betrayals, ecclesiastical hypocrisy, and spiritual turmoil forced course changes and identity changes. Riding these rapids with them, we watch helplessly as one drowns in guilt but we watch joyfully as the other finds wisdom and vocational clarity. An unforgettable read!â€Â </p>

  <p>â€œOne of the best elements of the novel is its continuously exciting development. The story grips the reader by its extraordinary sequence of events, right up to the final happenings which dominate the second part of the novel.  In creating a character of such interest and complexity as Kyle proves to be, Jack Lawson has written a remarkable novel and has opened up for the reader an amazing range of thoughts and questions.â€Â </p>
