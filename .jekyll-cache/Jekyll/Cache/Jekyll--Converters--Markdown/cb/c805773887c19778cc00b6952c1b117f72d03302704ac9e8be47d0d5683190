<h2 id="what-is-the-montgomery-trust">What is the Montgomery Trust?</h2>

<p>The purpose of the Trust is to promote lectures â€˜in explanation and defence of the Christian religion with a view to removing difficulties widely felt in the way of faith and to demonstrate the reasonableness of theistic beliefâ€™. Sir Alexander Montgomery of Albury, Surrey, was interested in making known to the public, particularly teachers, the results of modern scholarship on the Bible, with an emphasis upon Christian apologetics.</p>

<p>The Trust has three Advisers to oversee the programme - the Dean of St Paulâ€™s, the Dean of Westminster and the Dean of Kingâ€™s College, London.</p>

<p>The Advisers, together with the Chief Executive of Christian Education, are responsible for the appointment of lecturers. Christian Education undertakes the practical work of administration.</p>

<h2 id="who-chooses-a-topic">Who Chooses a Topic?</h2>

<p>The subject is one agreed between the lecturer and the local group and generally reflects the lecturerâ€™s own interests. The Montgomery Trust will pay the lecturerâ€™s fee of Â£120 and travelling expenses of 40p per mile or second class rail fare. Necessary overnight hotel accommodation may also be charged. For more information, please go toÂ <a href="http://www.montgomerytrust.org.uk/index.php">the Montgomery Trust website</a>.</p>
