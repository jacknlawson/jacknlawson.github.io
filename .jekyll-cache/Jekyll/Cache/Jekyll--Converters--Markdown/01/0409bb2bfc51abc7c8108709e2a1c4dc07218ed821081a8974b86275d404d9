I".<p>Prior to my retirement from full-time employment, I worked for the Methodist Church in East Anglia, UK, as a training &amp; development officer. Alongside this I taught and supervised dissertations on the M.A. in Pastoral Theology (Cambridge) and taught Biblical Hebrew.</p>

<p>Churches might be interested in knowing that I was also a lecturer for <a href="http://www.montgomerytrust.org.uk/">the Montgomery Trust </a>.. The purpose of the Trust is to promote lectures ‘in explanation and defence of the Christian religion with a view to removing difficulties widely felt in the way of faith and to demonstrate the reasonableness of theistic belief’. Sir Alexander Montgomery of Albury, Surrey, was interested in making known to the public, particularly teachers, the results of modern scholarship on the Bible, with an emphasis upon Christian apologetics.</p>

<p>I am available for training in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to the areas listed below. If there is an area you are interested in, please do <a href="/contactjack">get in contact</a>.</p>
