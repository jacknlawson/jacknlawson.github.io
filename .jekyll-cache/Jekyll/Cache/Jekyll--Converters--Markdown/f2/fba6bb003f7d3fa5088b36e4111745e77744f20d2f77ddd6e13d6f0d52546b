<h2 id="why-respite">Why Respite?</h2>
<p>Being in ministry can all-too-often become a 24/7 vocation: emergencies and bereavements never wait for convenient times. It is all too easy for ministers to postpone their much-needed rest time. It is interesting to note that in psychological profiles of people who enter ministry, most would consider themselves to be introverts; this makes sense as the spiritual life is an inward phenomenon in all of us. However, ministry is a very extraverted vocation—involving preaching, teaching, conducting weddings, baptisms and funerals, conducting meetings and more. This can and does take a toll on every minister over time.</p>

<p>In Jack’s work as a minister, and through his work as a training and development officer within the Methodist Church in Great Britain, he discovered that most ministers tend to avoid conflict. Makes sense at one level, doesn’t it? Who wants a confrontational minister? Yet, anyone who has spent even a few years in ministry knows that conflicts regularly arise within church communities. As ministers are considered the leaders of their faith communities—and often are also the chairmen of the trustees for church finances and property—conflict cannot be avoided forever and has to be faced. What then?</p>

<p>And then there are situations which can, for a variety of reasons, become toxic for the minister. This can happen within a congregation, a chaplaincy or social ministry. When that happens, it is not the minister alone who suffers but, if married, the spouse as well. At such times help and nurture are needed. And that is what we offer, for too often help is only available—if at all—for the ordained person.</p>
