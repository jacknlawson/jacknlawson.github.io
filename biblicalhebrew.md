## Why learn biblical Hebrew?

Whether you are Christian or Jew, reading the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in English (or any other translation) is like only being able to see life in black & white. Even a basic understanding of Hebrew will enhance your biblical understanding, providing a full-colour spectrum to what can often be, at best, fuzzy black & white.

## Nu? So what’s your background in Hebrew?

I began my Hebrew studies in 1975 with William L. Holladay (Andover Newton Theological School, author of A Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament and other books) and continued with Orval Wintermute (Duke University)—a walking compendium of ancient Near Eastern languages. I then went on to earn both an M.Phil and Ph.D in Hebraic and Cognate Studies from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Over the years I have taught both Jews and Christians, theological students and interested individuals, in formal groups and private tuition.
