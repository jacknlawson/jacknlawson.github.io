I was born (1952) and raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Well, in
fact, I grew up in Forsyth County on the *edge*, the *boundary*, of
Winston-Salem. A geographical fact which in time became an apt metaphor
for my life. Thus, until I was 11 years old, I attended *county
school*—not a small distinction in the late 1950s and early 60s. In
fact, my sister, brother and I all attended the same school as it ran
from first to twelfth grade! (There were giants on the earth in those
days.)

L.P. Hartley’s opening sentence in *The Go-Between* could aptly describe
what I remember of those days: “The past is a foreign country: they do
things differently there.”  Living on one of the main roads leading into
Winston-Salem from the north of the county, I can still vividly recall
horse- and mule-drawn wagons bringing produce to markets on Saturdays.

We also lived across the railroad and our busy road from R.J. Reynolds
tobacco warehouses, so the late-summer smell of tobacco and the
omnipresent tobacco bugs inhabit the memory of that foreign country. We

(See photo at right, which also shows me with my first car!) My maternal
grandfather, S.L. Collins, ran a grocery as well as a feed & seed
warehouse that would be frequented by both city and country folk—black
and white—again, not a small distinction in the still-Jim Crow South. My
paternal grandfather, George Washington Lawson, was a tenant farmer or
‘share-cropper,’ in the east of Forsyth County, having lost his farm
near Mt. Airy in the pre-1929 depression that hit the rural South. 

Both of my parents’ families were very large, so my pre-teen memories
are populated with images of myself running, playing and hiding both in
one grandfather’s warehouse and the other’s farm and barn.  I loved
active play, but was decidedly inward and what people called ‘bashful.’

Desiring to fly

My father, James C. Lawson, escaped the thrall of tenant-farming by
having joined the Marine Corps in 1941—August, I might add, for those
aware of the historical significance of the following December. 
Probably the only reason he survived the war and I am here is due to his
decision to join Marine Air Corps.  \[Most of his friends who enlisted
with him died in places such as Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\]  How
could they keep him down on the farm once he had discovered wings? 
Flying became his passion and his life’s work.
