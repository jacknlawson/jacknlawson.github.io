I wrote this 5-part Bible study to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King James Version of the Bible (2011). This anniversary has resulted in a renewed interest in the Bible and provides a good time to reflect on how we understand the Word of God in biblical terms. However, the topic is one that can be undertaken in any year! The focus of the study is the 'Word of God' - both how it is portrayed in Old and New Testaments and how we understand it today.

Words are the tools we use to frame what we know, to communicate with one another, to sing, to state our likes and dislikes, and to pray. Words are the tools we use to describe place, self and others - including God.

Again, this study is focussed on the Word of God in all its facets, but particularly in its written form.
