This article was first delivered as a lecture given at the Third Ecumenical Preaching Conference of the College of Preacher held at the Maryvale Pastoral Centre in September 1995. It was later published in the Centenary Issue of the College of Preachers’ Fellowship Paper 100 in January 1996. In this lecture I sought to examine the relationship between biblical prophecy and modern preaching.

> “In the final analysis, we, as Christian preachers, have the one principal model for our prophetic role and that is Jesus. And like those who came before him, Jesus spoke both the disturbing and the reassuring word of God to groups and to individuals, and by the fact that he proclaimed to people what was given him by the Father, he was prophetic; speaking to the specific needs of specific people in their time.”
