This lecture, which I delivered to the Ipswich Theological Society in April 2012, is also available for individual churches, synagogues and others.

The secretary for the Society, Raymond Wilson, had these remarks to share:

> “I am taking the opportunity of thanking you most warmly for your excellent lecture to the Ipswich Theological Society… It really was a superb occasion with many people present to hear you. You provided a thoughtful stimulus to preachers in our circuit, as well as some who are not preachers, and we are grateful to you, not least for leavening the lecture with humour. I believe you set a standard that we have to strive to maintain.”
