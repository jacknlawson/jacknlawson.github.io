I am a founding member of the Norwich Centre for Christian Learning, based at Norwich Cathedral, where I regularly lead seminars such as those above.  More information can be found on the web site: [www.norwichcentreforchristianlearning.co.uk](http://www.norwichcentreforchristianlearning.co.uk/)

Some of the groups and churches who have invited me to lead seminars are:

### Christian Ethics

In addition to my passion for Hebrew Bible, I have had a long time interest in Christian ethics and lecture on the MA in Pastoral Theology (Cambridge Theological Federation).

I also offer shorts seminars and church weekends on **“Christian Ethics and Everyday Life”** and **“Hard Choices: Christian Ethics in a Changing Bio-Medical World.”** Among others, I have led weekends for: the Provincial Weekend, Southern Province of the United Reformed Church, Staplehurst URC, church weekend, Christ Church (Anglican), Sidcup, parish weekend.
