I currently work for the Methodist Church in East Anglia and am involved in training & development work. Alongside this I teach and supervise dissertations on the M.A. in Pastoral Theology (Cambridge) and teach some Biblical Hebrew.

I am available for training in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to the areas listed below. If there is an area you are interested in, please do [get in contact](/contactjack).

In certain instances, my fees may be covered by The Montgomery Trust.

The purpose of the Trust is to promote lectures 'in explanation and defence of the Christian religion with a view to removing difficulties widely felt in the way of faith and to demonstrate the reasonableness of theistic belief'. Sir Alexander Montgomery of Albury, Surrey, was interested in making known to the public, particularly teachers, the results of modern scholarship on the Bible, with an emphasis upon Christian apologetics.

The subject is one agreed between the lecturer and the local group and generally reflects the lecturer's own interests. The Montgomery Trust will pay the lecturer's fee of £120 and travelling expenses of 40p per mile or second class rail fare. Necessary overnight hotel accommodation may also be charged. For more information, please go to [the Montgomery Trust website](http://www.montgomerytrust.org.uk/).
