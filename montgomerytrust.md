In certain instances, my fees may be covered by The Montgomery Trust.

## What is the Montgomery Trust?

The purpose of the Trust is to promote lectures 'in explanation and defence of the Christian religion with a view to removing difficulties widely felt in the way of faith and to demonstrate the reasonableness of theistic belief'. Sir Alexander Montgomery of Albury, Surrey, was interested in making known to the public, particularly teachers, the results of modern scholarship on the Bible, with an emphasis upon Christian apologetics.

The Trust has three Advisers to oversee the programme - the Dean of St Paul's, the Dean of Westminster and the Dean of King's College, London.

The Advisers, together with the Chief Executive of Christian Education, are responsible for the appointment of lecturers. Christian Education undertakes the practical work of administration.

## Who Chooses a Topic?

The subject is one agreed between the lecturer and the local group and generally reflects the lecturer's own interests. The Montgomery Trust will pay the lecturer's fee of £120 and travelling expenses of 40p per mile or second class rail fare. Necessary overnight hotel accommodation may also be charged. For more information, please go to [the Montgomery Trust website](http://www.montgomerytrust.org.uk/index.php).

## How Do I Book a Lecture?

Go to the Montgomery Trust website and [fill out an online form](http://www.montgomerytrust.org.uk/application.php). Complete the online form or print a form, complete and return it to the Trust. Applications should always be returned to the Christian Education office in this way, never direct to myself, please. Groups may apply in successive years provided they have returned a report form after previous Montgomery Lectures, but will only be allowed one lecture per academic year.
